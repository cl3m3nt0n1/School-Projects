 # SCHOOL PROJECTS

 ### DESCRIPTION

 This repository is a collection of codes and programs that I made throughout the years. Nothing fancy here just various results of hands-on works and activities or various mini-projects. This repository contains work in various languages and technologies mainly C, JAVA and Python. Of course, everything isn't there. This is mostly what I can recover and share easily.

 - C:

    This repo contains programs I developed mainly for an Operating Systems/System programming and data structures classes.
    
    - OS: 
        - These mainly revolves around the use of Signals, pipes, queues and other in-between processes communication methods. 
        - I found great help in Warren W. Gay *Programmation Linux* and Neil Matthew and Richard Stones *Linux Programming - 4th edition* books.
    - Data structures: 
        - Implementation of various data structures in C such as:
            - Binary tree
            - Queue
            - Stack
- FPGA: 

    This is just a basic seven segment decoder program made in VHDL.

- JAVA:
    - This is also a collection of (small) programs made using JAVA.
    - FTP/UDP/TCP server/client apps
    - Remote Method Invocation
    - A more complete project of a website based on JAVA, Spring, Springboot, bootstrap, thymeleaf and others.

- PYTHON:
    - In Python, I made several projects but mostly AI-related ones. I only share the last one consisting in the specification of resnet for music genres classification using spectrograms. It uses two differents databases GTZAN and MG (Music Genres) available on Hugging Face and Kaggle. The main objective was to try several training solutions and compare their results based on accuracy.
    - The second file is simpler and consists in a basic synth remotely controlled via a raspberry pi (with a custom distribution made using buildroot) and a client/server architecture based on Sockets. It uses tkinter for a simple GUI and pygame for sound generation.
- WEB: 
    - This is a collection of two websites that I made (including my first one) during school. They mostly use plain PHP, HTML, CSS.
    - Ludotheque: First ever website.
    - Conciergerie: Made for a relational database class.
